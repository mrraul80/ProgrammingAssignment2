## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do: Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly 
## (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). 
## Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m<-NULL
  set<-function(y){
    x<<-y
    m<<-NULL
  }
  get<-function() x
  setmatrix<-function(solve) m<<- solve
  getmatrix<-function() m
  list(set=set, get=get,
       setmatrix=setmatrix,
       getmatrix=getmatrix)
}



## Write a short comment describing this function

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by  makeCacheMatrix
## above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
## cacheSolve  should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x=matrix(), ...) {
  m<-x$getmatrix()
  if(!is.null(m)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  matrix <- x$get() 
  m<-solve(matrix, ...)
  x$setmatrix(m)
  m
}
